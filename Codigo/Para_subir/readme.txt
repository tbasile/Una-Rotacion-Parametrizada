Quantum simulation of Pauli channels and dynamical maps: algorithm and implementation

This repository has the code and results used for the article "Quantum simulation of Pauli channels and dynamical maps: algorithm and implementation". 

The repository includes the python notebook "Simulation of Pauli Channels.ipynb", which explains the general idea on how to construct a quantum circuit using Qiskit with the objective of simulating Pauli Channels. The quantum circuit is then used to simulate a sample of many one-qubit Pauli channels and obtain the fidelities of these simulations.

The resulting data is found on the folder "Simulation-ibmq_lima", which includes the fidelities obtained for all the channels simulated.

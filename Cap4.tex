\section{OPR circuit for a Pauli map}
\begin{itemize}
\item Use the last theorem to conclude which maps can be created using an OPR circuit.
\item \textbf{Examples:} Show examples that satisfy these conditions: Bit-Flip, parabolic maps, etc. and an example that doesn't satisfy the conditions.
\item \textbf{Results:} Show results of simulating those maps on a quantum computer. 
\end{itemize}

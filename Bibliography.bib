From an operational viewpoint, this norm measures how well we can distinguish between two channels by applying them to the input states of arbitrarily large dimensions. In this paper, we show that the diamond norm can be conveniently, and in a physically transparent way, computed by means of a Monte Carlo algorithm based on the Fano representation of quantum states and quantum operations. The effectiveness of this algorithm is illustrated for several single-qubit quantum channels.}

title = {Quantum Computing: A Gentle Introduction},
year = {2011},
isbn = {9780262015066},
publisher = {The MIT Press},
edition = {1st},
abstract = {The combination of two of the twentieth centurys most influential and revolutionary scientific theories, information theory and quantum mechanics, gave rise to a radically new view of computing and information. Quantum information processing explores the implications of using quantum mechanics instead of classical mechanics to model information and its processing. Quantum computing is not about changing the physical substrate on which computation is done from classical to quantum but about changing the notion of computation itself, at the most basic level. The fundamental unit of computation is no longer the bit but the quantum bit or qubit. This comprehensive introduction to the field offers a thorough exposition of quantum computing and the underlying concepts of quantum physics, explaining all the relevant mathematics and offering numerous examples. With its careful development of concepts and thorough explanations, the book makes quantum computing accessible to students and professionals in mathematics, computer science, and engineering. A reader with no prior knowledge of quantum physics (but with sufficient knowledge of linear algebra) will be able to gain a fluent understanding by working through the book. The text covers the basic building blocks of quantum information processing, quantum bits and quantum gates, showing their relationship to the key quantum concepts of quantum measurement, quantum state transformation, and entanglement between quantum subsystems; it treats quantum algorithms, discussing notions of complexity and describing a number of simple algorithms as well as the most significant algorithms to date; and it explores entanglement and robust quantum computation, investigating such topics as quantifying entanglement, decoherence, quantum error correction, and fault tolerance.}

@book{Haroche06,
    abstract = {{The counter-intuitive aspects of quantum physics have been for long illustrated by thought experiments, from Einstein's photon box to Schrodinger's cat. These experiments have now become real, with single particles - electrons, atoms or photons - directly unveiling the weird features of the quantum. State superpositions, entanglement and complementarity define a novel quantum logic which can be harnessed for information processing, raising great hopes for applications. This book describes a class of such thought experiments made real. Juggling with atoms and photons confined in cavities, ions or cold atoms in traps, is here an incentive to shed a new light on the basic concepts of quantum physics. Measurement processes and decoherence at the quantum-classical boundary are highlighted.  This volume, which combines theory and experiments, will be of interest to students in quantum physics, teachers seeking illustrations for their lectures and new problem sets, researchers in quantum optics and quantum information.}},

@article{Wolf2008,
abstract = {We investigate what a snapshot of a quantum evolution--a quantum channel reflecting open system dynamics--reveals about the underlying continuous time evolution. Remarkably, from such a snapshot, and without imposing additional assumptions, it can be decided whether or not a channel is consistent with a time (in)dependent Markovian evolution, for which we provide computable necessary and sufficient criteria. Based on these, a computable measure of "Markovianity" is introduced. We discuss how the consistency with Markovian dynamics can be checked in quantum process tomography. The results also clarify the geometry of the set of quantum channels with respect to being solutions of time (in)dependent master equations.},

@article{Ziman2010,
abstract = {A simple collision model is employed to introduce elementary concepts of open system dynamics of quantum systems. In particular, within the framework of collision models we introduce the quantum analogue of thermalization process called quantum homogenization and simulate quantum decoherence processes. These dynamics are driven by partial swaps and controlled unitary collisions, respectively. We show that collision models can be used to prepare multipartite entangled states. Partial swap dynamics generates W-type of entanglement saturating the CKW inequalities, whereas the decoherence collision models creates GHZ-type of entangled states. The considered evolution of a system in a sequence of collisions is described by a discrete semigroup E{\_}1,...,E{\_}n. Interpolating this discrete points within the set of quantum channels we derive for both processes the corresponding Lindblad master equations. In particular, we argue that collision models can be used as simulators of arbitrary Markovian dynamics, however, the inverse is not true.},

@article{Verstraete2002,
abstract = {One of the most challenging open problems in quantum information theory is to clarify and quantify how entanglement behaves when part of an entangled state is sent through a quantum channel. Of central importance in the description of a quantum channel or completely positive map (CP-map) is the dual state associated to it. The present paper is a collection of well-known, less known and new results on quantum channels, presented in a unified way. We will show how this dual state induces nice characterizations of the extremal maps of the convex set of CP-maps, and how normal forms for states defined on a Hilbert space with a tensor product structure lead to interesting parameterizations of quantum channels.},

@article{Horodecki,
abstract = {All our former experience with application of quantum theory seems to say: what is predicted by quantum formalism must occur in laboratory. But the essence of quantum formalism—entangle- ment, recognized by Einstein, Podolsky, Rosen and Schr¨ odinger — waited over 70 years to enter to laboratories as a new resource as real as energy. This holistic property of compound quantum systems, which involves nonclassical correlations be- tween subsystems, is a potential for many quantum processes, including “canonical” ones: quan- tum cryptography, quantum teleportation and dense coding. However, it appeared that this new resource is very complex and difficult to detect. Being usually fragile to environment, it is robust against conceptual and mathematical tools, the task of which is to decipher its rich structure. This article reviews basic aspects of entanglement including its characterization, detection, distil- lation and quantifying. In particular, the authors discuss various manifestations of entanglement via Bell inequalities, entropic inequalities, entanglement witnesses, quantum cryptography and point out some interrelations. They also discuss a basic role of entanglement in quantum com- munication within distant labs paradigm and stress some peculiarities such as irreversibility of entanglement manipulations including its extremal form — bound entanglement phenomenon. A basic role of entanglement witnesses in detection of entanglement is emphasized. Contents},

@article{filippov2017,
abstract = {Divisibility of dynamical maps is visualized by trajectories in the parameter space and analyzed within the framework of collision models. We introduce ultimate completely positive (CP) divisible processes, which lose CP divisibility under infinitesimal perturbations, and characterize Pauli dynamical semigroups exhibiting such a property. We construct collision models with factorized environment particles, which realize additivity and multiplicativity of generators of CP divisible maps. A mixture of dynamical maps is obtained with the help of correlated environment. Mixture of ultimate CP divisible processes is shown to result in a new class of eternal CP indivisible evolutions. We explicitly find collision models leading to weakly and essentially non-Markovian Pauli dynamical maps.},

@article{Frenzel2012,
abstract = {The Jaynes-Cummings model (JCM) describes the interaction of a two-level atom with a single quantised field mode in an optical cavity. In this BSc project we derive the basic Rabi model Hamiltonian and show how it leads to the JCM Hamiltonian. The results are then used to analyse the general time evolution of a bipartite atom-field system and its properties, such as entanglement. We extend a scheme developed by Browne and Plenio [D. Browne and M. B. Plenio, Physical Review A, vol. 67, no. 1, Jan. 2003.] to entangle two cavities that interact with an atom. Our scheme allows to produce states that are arbitrarily close to a Bell state with a success probability greater than 0.75, whereas the success rate of the original method tends to 0 for perfect fidelity. Further, we extend both schemes by allowing the atom or the cavity to be in a thermal state and find that the fidelity of the produced states is reduced with increasing temperature. Finally, we apply our scheme to quantum teleportation, where we find that the fidelity of the teleported state compared to the original state also decreases as the temperature is increased.},

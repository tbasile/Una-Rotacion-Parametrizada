abstract = {We present three different matrix bases that can be used to decompose density matrices of d-dimensional quantum systems, so-called qudits: the generalized Gell-Mann matrix basis, the polarization operator basis and the Weyl operator basis. Such a decomposition can be identified with a vector - the Bloch vector, i.e. a generalization of the well-known qubit case - and is a convenient expression for comparison with measurable quantities and for explicit calculations avoiding the handling of large matrices. We present a new method to decompose density matrices via so-called standard matrices, consider the important case of an isotropic two-qudit state and decompose it according to each basis. In the case of qutrits we show a representation of an entanglement witness in terms of expectation values of spin-1 measurements, which is appropriate for an experimental realization. {\textcopyright} 2008 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

The former concept is fully characterized in terms of local generator whereas it is in general not true for the latter one. A simple example of random unitary dynamics of a qubit shows the intricate difference between those approaches. Moreover, in this case both approaches are fully characterized in terms of local decoherence rates. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Holevo capacity is the maximum rate at which a quantum channel can reliably transmit classical information without entanglement. However, calculating the Holevo capacity of arbitrary quantum channels is a nontrivial and computationally expensive task since it requires the numerical optimization over all possible input quantum states. In this paper, we consider discrete Weyl channels (DWCs) and exploit their symmetry properties to model DWC as a classical symmetric channel. We characterize lower and upper bounds on the Holevo capacity of DWCs using simple computational formulae. Then, we provide a sufficient and necessary condition where the upper and lower bounds coincide. The framework in this paper enables us to characterize the exact Holevo capacity for most of the known special cases of DWCs.},

   abstract = {Quantum information theory is a branch of science at the frontier of physics, mathematics, and information science, and offers a variety of solutions that are impossible using classical theory. This book provides a detailed introduction to the key concepts used in processing quantum information and reveals that quantum mechanics is a generalisation of classical probability theory. The second edition contains new sections and entirely new chapters: the hot topic of multipartite entanglement; in-depth discussion of the discrete structures in finite dimensional Hilbert space, including unitary operator bases, mutually unbiased bases, symmetric informationally complete generalized measurements, discrete Wigner function, and unitary designs; the Gleason and Kochen–Specker theorems; the proof of the Lieb conjecture; the measure concentration phenomenon; and the Hastings' non-additivity theorem. This richly-illustrated book will be useful to a broad audience of graduates and researchers interested in quantum information theory. Exercises follow each chapter, with hints and answers supplied.},

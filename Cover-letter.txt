To whom it may concern:

I am writing to submit our research article entitled   “Quantum simulation of
Pauli channels and dynamical maps: algorithm and implementation” to be
considered for publication as a research article in PLOS One. 

In this article, we focus on one of the fundamental purposes of quantum
computers since their inception: simulating quantum systems. Specifically, we
propose and simulate on a quantum computer an algorithm for implementing
Pauli channels. These channels are transformations of qubit systems typically 
arising from noise affecting quantum devices; they are examples of the
evolution of open quantum systems, which have garnered interest due to their
applications in the study of entanglement and dissipative processes.

Moreover, we extend the algorithm to encompass Pauli channels dependent on a
parameter, which we refer to as Pauli dynamical maps. This extension leads us
to investigate quantum algorithms with parameter-dependent operations, known as
parametrized quantum circuits.  In this manuscript, we establish the
mathematical conditions necessary for implementing any parametrized operation
using a quantum circuit using only one parametrized single qubit operation. We
believe these findings will be of interest to readers of your esteemed journal.

We declare the manuscript’s originality and exclusivity for publication. In
addition, we have not had any prior interactions with PLOS regarding this
manuscript. In the event that our manuscript is chosen for review, we kindly
suggest Dr. Fabio Sciarrino as a suitable reviewer, given his background and
expertise to evaluate our findings. We have no objections to any other
potential reviewers.

Each named author has significantly contributed to the research and preparation
of this manuscript. Furthermore, the named authors have no conflicts of
interest to disclose.

Thank you for considering our work.

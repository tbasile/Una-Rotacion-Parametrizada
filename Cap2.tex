\section{Circuits for Pauli Maps}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Circuit for a Pauli channel:}  Propose a circuit to simulate a Pauli channel on $n$ qubits. It works by creating a $2n$-qubit state on ancilla qubits.
\item \textbf{Simulation:} Show the fidelities of simulating the circuit on a quantum computer for many different one-qubit channels inside the tetrahedron.
\item \textbf{For Pauli dynamical maps}: See how the circuit generalizes to parametrized channels and notice that many rotations are needed to create the $2n$-ancilla qubit state.
\end{itemize}
